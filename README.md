# Set up
###### Set up process assumes that all of the above technologies are available on your machine
1. run `git clone https://github.com/terrancexin/konnect.git && cd konnect`
2. run `npm install`
3. open 3 terminal windows:
  - please make sure `mongod` database is running
  - please make sure `webpack -w` is running
  - start the app by `npm run dev`
4. open a new browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`

##### Set up extras
- insert fake seeds by uncommenting line:31 in `server/index.js` and restart the server
- clear the database by uncommenting line:14 in `server/index.js`
- enable LAN mode on line:23 in `client/actions/index.js` and comment out line:25
  - run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` in the terminal
  - open a new browser with the ip address and port 3000 on any connected devices in the same network
  - e.g. `http://192.168.1.123:3000`
  - now you're able to chat across devices in real time
